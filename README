To run this project:
0. Install Vagrant and Virtualbox 5.1.0 (or whatever version they recommend).
Set up your Facebook API App ID and App secret in oauth_example_app.py.
Set your app's URL in developers.facebook.com to whatever local IP and port you
will be using for development, E.g. http://192.168.56.2:5000/
1. Run "vagrant up" inside the project directory.  This initializes the VM.  It
could take a while the first time you run it, since it may have to download
a Vagrant box image, plus it will install a bunch of packages inside it,
including all the pip packages listed in requirements.txt.
2. Run "vagrant ssh" to log into the VM.
3. Run "python3 /vagrant/oauth_example_app.py runserver -h 0.0.0.0" inside the
VM.  (The project root will be mounted to /vagrant within the VM.)  The
server should then be accessible in your web browser at
http://192.168.56.2:5000/ (or whatever IP address you configured
inside Vagrantfile).

The included Vagrantfile will make the VM accessible at 192.168.56.2 via a
Virtualbox private network, so the Flask web server should only be visible to
the Vagrant host (i.e. your development workstation).  SSH will, however, be
forwarded to port 2222 on the host computer, meaning you can log into the VM
 from any computer on your LAN using the correct login credentials.

To login to the VM, SSH into 192.168.56.2:22 or localhost:2222.  The username
is "vagrant", and you use a private key located in
".vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key".
You can also just run "vagrant ssh" in the project root.

PyCharm is the IDE I use.  You can set up the Vagrant environment as a
"remote interpreter", and then everything will work pretty much as if you
were using a local Python interpreter and virtualenv.
